/*
 * With all the chaos in the Critter world lately, everyone and their mother is
 * getting worried.  Especially the moms.  In fact, the mothers are so worried that
 * they will fight any other Critter they come across (except other mothers),
 * doing the most damage to Craig, who reminds them of their children.
 * They both run around frantically and reproduce quickly, recruiting other mothers
 * for their cause.  After a few fights, however, they have to sit down and rest,
 * so they don't move for a few time steps.
